# Login System
___

**Description**
A simple system that allows users to login using a username and password.
If the user doesn't already have an account they will have the option to create a new account.
The information will be in stored in an sqlite database. 

**Ideas**
- use encryption to store the passwords in the database 
- create a frontend or gui to use instead of just command-line interface
- use `getpass` module to keep passwords secure when being input by the user
